- Designed an item response theory based scoring pipeline that maps GRIT traits to adaptive survey questions with literature-backed correlations.
- Automated data collection with Selenium and generated synthetic samples via GANs to balance sparse segments, improving robustness of the scoring curves.
- Shipped the model into the UCB psychometric platform and Predli startup workflows, enabling individualized evaluations with transparent scoring.
